# CameraMod

CameraMod is *a tool devoted for movie makers*. It allows its users to use free camera mod, to create camera paths and then move camera along them together with hidden game GUI. More features (such as a complex composition of multiple tracks, multiple controlled objects, movement recording etc) are in progress.

Originally, the mod was coded in November 2014 to provide a movie making utility for Mafia:TCoLH.  

## Supported games
* Mafia:The City of Lost Heaven (version 1.0)
* more are possibly coming in future (would love to see **GTA3 / Gothic**)
